Noot done too much but my coding, oh my word!!! Needs a catchup. Just saw the site that I'm supposed to learn from has instruction in Java. Anyway, not sure about how I'll do it, but i will hehehehehe.

This is entry 1/76


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_entry(sentence)
  puts "DAY , #{sentence}"
end
print_entry('2: i made 3 apps with flutter in 29 hours')
#=> prints 'Day 2: i made 3 apps with flutter in 29 hours' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Done
